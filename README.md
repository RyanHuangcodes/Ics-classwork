# Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?

# I am taking this grade 11 computer science course for a multitude of reasons, I am looking forward to majoring in computer engineer
# and a credit and high grade in this course can really boost me to achieve a good university for the program. I really want to learn how
# to code well in python which is a language I am not previously experienced in and also increasing my focus and work. I feel very ambitious # to do most of the classwork as I feel quite passionate and comfortable doing most of it. Im looking forward to coming out with a higher
# understanding and ability in coding, more experience with computers, and a greater appreciation for both the course and the wonderful,
# calm and powerful teacher that guides us through the course.

# What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features.

# A game that I believe is designed very well is a game called Unreal Engine which is believed to be the most realistic game out there 
# currently. The graphics combined with the physics make the game greatly developed, which must of took developers a long period of time and # perseverance. I would love to learn to implement some sort of physics into a game. Although, my level in math is not quite high enough to 
# to reach the level of physics as the developers of Unreal Engine, I always try to aim high and attempt to achieve something relatively 
# close. If I were to create a game with similar physics I would try to create a similar 2d adventure game almost like Minecraft where I can
# add motion, momentum, waves, etc(these all require physics). I am really looking forward to learning in this computer science course!
